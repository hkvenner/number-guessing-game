# number-guessing-game
 In this project, I built a console game to demonstrate my knowledge of Python basics such as accepting input and generating output, types, conditional branching, loops, exception handling and basic math for data analysis. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

The user's job is to make a guess, and the program tells them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what the program tells them. If the user guesses the right answer the game is done.
